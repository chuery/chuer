## Quotes I live by

“Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. *Be always searching for new sensations.* Be afraid of nothing.”
― Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray

Otherwise this stone would seem defaced<br />
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders<br />
and would not glisten like a wild beast’s fur:<br />
would not, from all the borders of itself,<br />
burst like a star: for here there is no place<br />
that does not see you. <em>You must change your life.</em><br />
- Rainer Maria Rilke, <em>Archaic Torso of Apollo</em>
