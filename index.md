    <strong>Maximizing the novel sensations I can experience in this lifetime!</strong><br><br>
    
    Hi! I’m Chuer, a junior at Stanford majoring in Symbolic Systems with a concentration in Physics and a minor in Data Science. I’m passionate about energy and tech for sustainability +  how we can use tech for cool art!
    
    I'm currently helping plan Stanford Climate Week (October 20-26, 2025) and BASES Challenge (Jan - March 2026). I also conduct research with Cortico at the MIT Media Lab and write/edit for the Stanford Daily.
    
    Previously, I've worked against jail expansions with Decarcerate Sacramento, conducted hydrology fieldwork with the USGS, designed and created the initial prototype for a learning platform for students with intellectual developmental disorders at the Stanford GSE Lemons Lab.
