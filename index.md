## Quotes I Live By

"Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
and would not glisten like a wild beast’s fur:

would not, from all the borders of itself,
burst like a star: for here there is no place
that does not see you. *You must change your life.*"
- Rainer Maria Rilke, Archaic Torso of Apollo 

“Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. *Be always searching for new sensations.* Be afraid of nothing.”
― Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray
