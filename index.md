## Quotes I live by

“Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. *Be always searching for new sensations.* Be afraid of nothing.”
― Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray

<li>"Otherwise this stone would seem defaced</li>
<li>beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders</li>
<li>and would not glisten like a wild beast’s fur:</li>
<li>would not, from all the borders of itself,</li>
<li>burst like a star: for here there is no place
that does not see you. *You must change your life.*"
- Rainer Maria Rilke, Archaic Torso of Apollo
